# Ford GoBike System data

## Dataset

This data set is related to a bike sharing data business that consist of approximately 200,000 rows with more that 20 different variables. In this project we will examine the relationships between different variables and how they shape certain phenomena.

## Summary of Findings

The most important variable to consider in this data is the duration_sec variable which represents the total time required for specific journey. This variable has been discovered to be linked with other variables inn the data such as locationsâ€™ longitude and latitude. Also, we found that most of the customers are non-subscribers which should encourage managers to study this fact more.

## Key Insights for Presentation

We present at the end of this work several key insights and figure that relate to the connection between duration_sec and other important variables.
